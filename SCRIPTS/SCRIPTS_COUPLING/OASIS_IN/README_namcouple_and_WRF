The namcouple.base.* proposed in this directory are made:

* either for WRFV4.2.1 in the version available at: https://github.com/wrf-croco/WRF
* either for WRFV4.6 in the version available at: https://github.com/massonseb/WRF/tree/GMD_wrf_coupling

The names of coupled variables for OASIS between these 2 versions have changed. 
Depending on the WRF version you are using you should link the corresponding namcouple* in the current directory:
* ln -s for_WRFV4.2.1CROCO/* .
or
* ln -s for_WRFV4.6GMD/* .

Note that if you want to use the TOY model on behalf of WRF you should check the variable names in: 
SCRIPTS_TOOLBOX/OASIS_SCRIPTS/create_oasis_toy_files.sh

They are currently set for WRFV4.6, but you can modify them to be coherent with WRFV4.2.1
