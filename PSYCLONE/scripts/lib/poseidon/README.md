========

This directory contain the base of a tool we will use to work more on CRCO
code analysis and reshaping. It is here just use as a library for some of
its routines & classes to inject the OpenACC directives.

Remark
------

It is currently more required for exploration than for a strict need.
I made the necessary to reduce as much as possible the dependencies in
`../extensions` function not to use those helpers so we can at the end
probably remove this set of source from CRCCO dir.
