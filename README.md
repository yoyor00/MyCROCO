# CROCO 

CROCO is an oceanic modeling system built upon ROMS_AGRIF and maintained by IRD, INRIA, CNRS, IFREMER and SHOM, French institutes working on environmental sciences and applied mathematics. An important objective for CROCO is to resolve very fine scales (especially in the coastal area), and their interactions with larger scales. It includes new capabilities such as a non-hydrostatic solver, ocean-wave-atmosphere coupling, evolving sediment dynamics and marine biogeochemistry, new high-order numerical schemes for advection and mixing, and a dedicated I/O server (XIOS).
