CROCO-NH is non-hydrostatic version of CROCO, alternative to CROCO-NBQ.

The CROCO-NH branch of CROCO has been developed by

Molemaker M. J. nmolem@atmos.ucla.edu
Roullet, G.     roullet@univ-brest.fr
Ducousso, N.    Nicolas.Ducousso@ifremer.fr
Grima, N.       Nicolas.Grima@univ-brest.fr

The branch was originally maintained on
https://github.com/ducousso/CROCO-NH

and the first version of the NHMG library was on
https://github.com/ngrigri/NHMG

The branch is now merged into the main CROCO repository.

CROCO-NH enforces the incompressibility by solving a Poisson equation
for the non-hydrostatic pressure, the computation of the hydrostatic
pressure remains unchanged. The Poisson equation is solved using a
geometric multigrid algorithm, whose source is in the CROCO/NHMG
folder.

CROCO-NH prognoses wz, the "contravariant" component of the vertical
velocity, viz. the flux through sigma surfaces. In CROCO-NH, contrary
to CROCO-NBQ, wz is not the true vertical velocity, it is Omega.
